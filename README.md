TIMELINE(24:45/27:46)
NOTE: Took a small 30 minutes project which teaches you the very basics in order to connect your React.js project to a Django backend. Now to take what I had learned and re-create this same process but this time create a second process But take this learning project and make something completely different from what I learned. Also, the things which I don't know Google my way out of the situation and gain experience by doing versus following a tutorial. Wish me luck!
